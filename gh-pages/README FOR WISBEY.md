Okay this is the game mate, to run it on your laptop do the following:

- Copy/Paste the whole game folder (floppybird-gh-pages) onto your desktop
- Open Terminal from the Applications Folder
- Type/paste the following commands into terminal one at a time:


cd Desktop/floppybird-gh-pages/

open index.html


- Okay after that a safari/chrome window should pop up and it should play!

I'll keep working on uploading it to my GitHub or something and it should then play from a weblink. I'll try and work out how to keep editing it because I want more SMB propaganda in there haha
